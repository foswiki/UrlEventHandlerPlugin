---++ Introduction
Lets you react on specific URL parameters. This is primally used for triggering confirn, error or simple message dilaogs or javascript alerts. An example would be, that after an upload you get redirected to the topci and a small
alert opens, and tells you 'File successfully attached to the topic'. You press on ok and keep on working. You also can show complex dialogs or messages in dialogs.

Example for the confirmation message after an attachment has been uploaded to a topic:%BR%
<verbatim>
/bin/view/Main/WebHome?ueh_type=alert&ueh_confirmcode=attachok
</verbatim>
