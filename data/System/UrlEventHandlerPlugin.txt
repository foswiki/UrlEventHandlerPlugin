---++ Introduction

%RED% *!!!IMPORTANT!!!!*: Please secure the *Codes* topics, because they can be used for X-Site-Attacks! *ALLOWTOPICCHANGE* is set to *AdminGroup* by default. After you added your codes you should also remove the "w" flag on the filesystem to be 100% secure in this point
%ENDCOLOR%%BR%
%TOPIC% enables you to run specific actions on URL specific parameters. This is primary used for triggering confirm, error or simple message dialogs or javascript alerts. An example would be, that you get redirected to an topic after an upload and suddenly an alert opens, and tells you 'File successfully attached to the topic'. You press the OK-Button and keep on working. You also can show complex dialogs or messages in dialogs.
%BR%
Example for the confirmation message after an attachment has been uploaded to a topic:%BR%
<verbatim>
/bin/view/Main/WebHome?ueh_type=alert&ueh_confirmcode=attachok
</verbatim>

---++ Installation instructions
   * Just use the installer attached to the topic or even easier, use the configure-system/Extension to easy install it through an user-interface
*Note:* You do not need to install anything on the browser to use this plugin. The following instructions are for the administrator who installs the Plugin on the server where Foswiki is running.

---++ TODO
   * implement the message in the dialog ( type=mdialog )
   * let alerts / mdialogs also work, if no JS is activated. In that case, a layer should be added to the body ( in the upper liek FLASHNOTE )
<!--
   * Set SHORTDESCRIPTION = Lets you react on url parameters and e.g. show a message for the user or redirect him somewhere, show a dialog etc.
